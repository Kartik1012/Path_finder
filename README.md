This is a simplistic react application that was created to display several path-finding methods. You may use this app at https://wonderful-mcclintock-c87d7e.netlify.app/. I haven't done much style in this project, so it could appear too good, but i hope you'll appreciate the animations.

Algorithms used Dijkstra, A-star, DFS, BFS
